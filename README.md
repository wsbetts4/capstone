# The Wolves of Yellowstone 
> This follows winter migratory patterns as the Gray Wolves track their prey, specifically elk, throughout both the Yellowstone National Park and Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.

## Summary
The Yellowstone National Park was established in 1872 and roughly 50 years later, by 1926, the wolf population had been eradicated. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 paved the way for the reintroduction of the Gray wolf into the Yellowstone National Park in 1995. This project takes a look at the reintroduction process through the lens of a study by Jeremy Cusack, Dan Stahler, Doug Smith, et. al. where they observed wolves interacting with elk over the winter months from 2004 to 2016. I was most interested in visualizing the wolves movement patterns over the years and understanding the relation of these movements with the park boundaries and pack territories.   

## Motivation
Originally, I wanted to create a tool to look at national parks and where certain animals would be during certain times of the year. I decided to represent this tool with a Minimun Viable Product that looked at one animal (the wolf) in one park (Yellowstone National Park). Once, I started my research, I fell in love with the story of the wolf introduction into Yellowstone and decided that I wanted to dig deeper into it. I realized that my interests aligned more with the introduction narrative and that I wanted to bring it to life through data visualization. 

## Data Questions
How many wolves call Yellowstone their home? Where do these wolves travel during the winter periods? Are they closely bunched as packs or are there singular tracks that represent the "lone wolf"?

## Thanks
A special thanks to Erin Stahler with the Yellowstone National Park Service for helping me out, maintaining all of the data and their bases, and keeping the wolves safe. Also, thanks to Jeremy Cusack, Micehl Kohl, Matthew Metz, Tim Coulson, Daniel Stahler, Douglas Smith, and Daniel MacNulty for sharing their data and publishing their study, Weak spatiotemporal response of prey to predation risk in a freely interacting system, which was a great help. Lastly, Yellowstone Wolves edited by Douglas Smith, Daniel Stahler, and Daniel MacNulty is just awesome.
